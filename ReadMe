The Process Improvement: Check Reconciliation project had the intended purpose of presenting to management the business case to reduce the check processing time by 25% and save the company $7200 in annual spending. By creating a plan, measuring, analyzing, and implementing the findings, the process improvement performed as expected. The clear manner in which it was presented gave business stakeholders a clear understanding of what was to be expected and for those involved, their roles were clearly defined as well.

This folder contains a presentation and the initial proposal used to demonstrate the different stages of my process improvement plan and implementation.
